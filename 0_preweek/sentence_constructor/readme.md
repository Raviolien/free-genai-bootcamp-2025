# Homework sentence constructor

## Chosen language
I have chosen to work with French as I know some French and know absolutely no Japanese. 

## Models
I'm using the free tier. 

### ChatGPT 
It tells me it runs GPT-4-turbo. I also tested on GPT-3.5 as I hit the limit of free uses on GPT-4

### Mistral AI 
It didn't specify what model it is using

### Meta AI 
Apparently not available in my country (Denmark)

### Anthropic Claude
Claude 3.5 Haiku

### DeepSeek
DeepSeek-V3 and DeepThink (R1)


## How I did

### Creating the prompt document
- First, I created a prompt document that worked with ChatGPT 4o, where I define "worked" as providing the vocabulary table, sentence structure, clues, extra clues upon student's request, feedback and further clues upon student's attempts, and verrification of correct translation by the student as I would like them to be. 
- As I ran out of free tier usage of 4o, the prompt document was also tested on GPT 3.5. For this model to work extra examples needed to be added. 
- Next, I added to the prompt document so it worked with Mistral AI
- Next, I added to the prompt document so it worked with Claude.
- Last, I tried the prompt document with DeepSeek. No changed to the prompt document needed.
